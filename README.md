# STEP 1

Add a typable-dropdown like <a href="https://github.com/indrimuska/jquery-editable-select" target="_blank">THIS ONE HERE</a> (Web <a href="http://indrimuska.github.io/jquery-editable-select/" target="_blank">DEMO</a>)

# STEP 2

Once you have that box copied onto our site, make it work with the API here. There are 900 entries, and they should display inside the editable dropdown box.

# STEP 3

Once it is displaying all the ID's (names), make it so when someone clicks it, it displays a new entry box for it like the 2 examples at the top, "Bit" and "Maid" so that people can enter in amounts, and the API gets the value, and it is added to the total. See the code in our index.html <script > tag to see the API code that you can copy for this.

# STEP 4 

FINISHED!!! Collect PAYMENT $$
